3) First Table: Provide a table with brief summary statistics: sample size, average age in the population, distribution of education, occupation
4) Second Table: Perform a regression of log wages on a gender dummy variable without other controls (unconditional wage gap). Perform similar regressions but include progressively additional sets of control variables. Report regression results in a single table across different columns as in an academic paper. Comment the results
5) Third Table: Perform the same exercise but separately for those with more and less than high-school education
6) Fourth Table (not compulsory): Perform further analysis that you might find interesting 7) Comment

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
TEST TEST

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
